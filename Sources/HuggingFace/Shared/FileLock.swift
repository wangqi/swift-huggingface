/// A file-based lock for coordinating access to shared resources.
///
/// `FileLock` provides file locking using `flock(2)` to enable safe
/// concurrent access to cache files from multiple processes.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let lock = FileLock(path: blobPath)
/// try lock.withLock {
///     // Exclusive access to the resource
///     try data.write(to: blobPath)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The lock is automatically released when the closure completes or throws.
///
/// ## Lock File Location
///
/// The lock file is created alongside the target path with a `.lock` extension.
/// For example, locking `/cache/blobs/abc123` creates `/cache/blobs/abc123.lock`.
public struct FileLock: Sendable {
    /// The path to the lock file.
    public let lockPath: URL

    /// Maximum number of lock acquisition attempts.
    public let maxRetries: Int

    /// Delay between retry attempts in seconds.
    public let retryDelay: TimeInterval

    /// Creates a file lock for the specified path.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - path: The path to the resource being protected.
    ///   - maxRetries: Maximum number of lock acquisition attempts. Defaults to 5.
    ///   - retryDelay: Delay between retry attempts in seconds. Defaults to 1.0.

    /// and then releases the lock. If the lock cannot be acquired after the maximum
    /// number of retries, an error is thrown.
